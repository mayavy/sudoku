    Built as my first web, python & django project, tried to include lot of coding not just CRUD, tried to make it a bit
    different , didn't want make copy ecommerce or social media because making such application production grade is
    continous challenge, ie. I could never build it enough ! one cheat build from internet tutorial would not able to
    enhance much of my thinking ability related to web-developement. <br /><br />I wrote algorithm for sudoku image
    recongnition,
    cleaning it and extracting 81 smaller blocks containing 81 digits but identifying actuall digit out of those 81
    smaller blocks is being done by Tesseract-OCR, so It may not be perfect. While uploading image to be identfied make
    sure it has got only the big square block containing the sudoku.<br /><br /> Could've worked more on frontend or
    styling the
    website with the help of Bootstrap or something but I styled it myself from scratch with CSS, which taught me how to
    get started with Boostrap ie because of manual CSS styling now I can think of trying out Bootstrap.<br /><br /> That
    it
    from me,
    solve sudoku in free time , stay sharp atleast it will make you think that you are :)
